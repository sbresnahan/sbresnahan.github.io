## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

---

**Penn State University**, Doctoral Researcher - 2019-present
Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences; Drs. Christina Grozinger and Michael Axtell  

- Constructed and sequenced mRNA and small RNA sequencing libraries
- Analyzed and interpreted genome-wide mRNA-seq, Nanopore direct-seq (RNA m6A), ChIP-seq, DNA-seq, and small RNA-seq data using R and python
- Identified transcriptional and epigenetic differences associated with phenotypic variation in honey bees, including within an allele-specific analysis framework
- Utilized machine learning methods to infer gene regulatory networks associated with phenotypic variation
- Designed, optimized, and implemented software for metagenomics sequence database curation to assess floral diversity in pollen samples

**University of Nebraska, Omaha**, Undergraduate Researcher - 2017-2019
Department of Biology; Dr. Ryan Wong  

- Generated mutant zebrafish lines using CRISPR/Cas9 to study influence of candidate genes on stress-coping behavior, learning, and memory

Department of Mathematics; Dr. Jim Rogers  

- Constructed and analyzed dynamic systems models of protein-protein interaction networks
