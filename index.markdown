I am broadly interested in developmental and behavioral biology, transcriptomics & functional genomics, particularly at the maternal-offspring interface. I currently work as a postdoctoral data scientist with [Arjun Bhattacharya](https://bhattacharya-lab.com) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, exploring the biological mechanisms contributing to cancer risk and outcomes and developmental phenotypes using large genetic, functional genomic, and clinical datasets through international collaborations. My doctoral research with [Christina Grozinger](https://www.grozingerlab.com/), [Michael Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/), [Shaun Mahony](https://mahonylab.org/), [Heather Hines](https://hineslab.org/), and [Amro Zayed](http://zayedlab.apps01.yorku.ca/wordpress/) (York University - Toronto, Canada) through the [Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences](https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-cellular-and-integrative-biosciences) PhD program at Penn State University examined [molecular mechanisms of phenotypic variation in honey bees](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19186stb5321), focusing on parent-of-origin intragenomic conflicts. [See my resume](/assets/docs/Bresnahan_Resume_020224.pdf) for more details.
