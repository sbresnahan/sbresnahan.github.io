I study social insect behavior, developmental plasticity, and gene regulation. I use molecular biology and bioinformatics tools, and work with genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data. My research projects examine the gene regulatory processes that underlie phenotypic and behavioral variation in a model social insect species, the honey bee (*Apis mellifera*). I am currently completing the [Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences](https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-cellular-and-integrative-biosciences) PhD program at Penn State University, advised by Drs. [Christina Grozinger](https://www.grozingerlab.com/), [Michael Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/), [Shaun Mahony](https://mahonylab.org/), [Heather Hines](https://hineslab.org/), and [Amro Zayed](http://zayedlab.apps01.yorku.ca/wordpress/) (York University - Toronto, Canada). I also write [bioinformatics software](/software) and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in bioinformatics, data analysis, and molecular biology. I plan to defend my thesis on "Intragenomic Conflict and Phenotypic Variation in Honey Bees (*Apis mellifera*)" in 2024, and am seeking post-doctoral and industry research positions. [See my CV](/CV) for more details.
