I study social insect behavior, developmental plasticity, and gene regulation. I utilize molecular biology and bioinformatics tools, and work with genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data. My research projects focus on the 1) the influence of [intragenomic conflicts](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0354-9) in honey bee (*Apis mellifera*) behavior and development, and 2) the gene regulatory mechanisms driving parent-of-origin allele-specific transcription (genomic imprinting) in social insects. I am currently working on my dissertation research at the Pennsylvania State University with [Christina Grozinger](https://www.grozingerlab.com/), [Michael Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/), [Shaun Mahony](https://mahonylab.org/), [Heather Hines](https://hineslab.org/), and [Amro Zayed](http://zayedlab.apps01.yorku.ca/wordpress/) (York University - Toronto, Canada). I also write bioinformatics software and mentor undergraduate students in data analysis, molecular biology, and honey bee husbandry. [See my CV](/CV) for more details.
