I am a postdoctoral data scientist in the [Department of Epidemiology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/epidemiology.html) and [Institute for Data Science in Oncology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/institutes/institute-for-data-science-in-oncology.html) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with [Dr. Arjun Bhattacharya](https://bhattacharya-lab.com) and [Dr. Paul Scheet](http://scheet.org). I am currently seeking Associate Scientist positions in computational biology, bioinformatics, data science, clinical genomics, and NGS/genomics core support. My research focuses on developing robust bioinformatics pipelines and computational methods for multi-omic data integration, with particular expertise in RNA isoform analyses and epigenomic profiling. I am interested in applying my skills to biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, precision medicine, and clinical diagnostic development. I seek opportunities to leverage population-scale genomic datasets (including biobank resources, cancer genomics cohorts, and clinical trial data) to characterize disease mechanisms, support drug development, and advance patient care. I am particularly drawn to roles that bridge fundamental genomic science with translational and clinical applications, where I can contribute to both algorithm development and strategic implementation of bioinformatics infrastructure.


My current research investigates how gene regulatory mechanisms influence human development and health across the life course. I integrate multi-omic approaches with machine learning and statistical genetics frameworks to uncover how genomic and environmental factors shape developmental trajectories and disease risk. A unifying goal is to move beyond gene-level associations toward mechanistic, isoform-resolved models of gene regulation that deepen biological insight and support clinical translation. My work spans maternal-placental and cancer biology, focusing on how gestational exposures such as diabetes and environmental chemicals like PFAS disrupt placental gene regulation and contribute to altered fetal growth, neurodevelopment, and cancer risk.

I graduated with a PhD in [Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences](https://www.huck.psu.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-cellular-and-integrative-biosciences) from The Pennsylvania State University in 2024, supervised by [Dr. Christina Grozinger](https://www.grozingerlab.com/) and [Dr. Michael Axtell](https://sites.psu.edu/axtell/) in the [Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences](https://www.huck.psu.edu). Throughout my doctoral research, in which I was supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org), I studied [molecular mechanisms of phenotypic variation in honey bees (*Apis mellifera*)](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19186stb5321), focusing on genetic and epigenetic regulation, including parent-of-origin intragenomic conflict, as drivers of behavioral and physiological responses to environmental conditions. 

I graduated in 2019 from the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) with a BS in [Neuroscience](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/index.php). As an undergraduate, I was awarded a research grant through the UNO [Fund for Undergraduate Scholarly Experience](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=unomaha+fuse&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) to investigate the genetic basis of stress coping behaviors in zebrafish [using CRISPR/Cas9](https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/srcaf/2019/Schedule/23/) with [Dr. Ryan Wong](https://wonglab.unomaha.community) in the Department of Biology. I also worked with Dr. Jim Rogers in the Department of Mathematics to develop a [network model](https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/srcaf/2019/Schedule/118/) of protein-protein interactions in macrophage cells to study HIV infection.
